# Science Fair Showcase Page 🔬

A lightweight, high-performance landing page built to showcase a Science Fair video project and facilitate real-time student interaction through a managed comment system.

## 💡 Smart Integration: Serverless Comments
Since the project required a quick and cost-free way to gather feedback, I opted for a clever architectural shortcut:
- **Solution:** Integrated **Giscus**, which uses GitHub Discussions as a database.
- **The "Why":** This allowed the students to comment and interact without the need for a custom backend or database maintenance, keeping the project 100% static and secure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript & CSS:** Built with pure web standards for instant loading and zero dependencies.
- **tsParticles:** Added a subtle, scientific-themed particle background to enhance the visual experience without compromising performance.
- **Giscus API:** Leveraged for the interaction layer.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Video-Centric UI:** Clean layout focused on the primary project content.
- **Zero-Maintenance:** Hosted on Vercel with no server-side management required.
- **High Performance:** Minimalist code footprint, ensuring it runs perfectly even on older school computers or mobile data.
